[Git Source](https://github.com//Team3dVidyaGames/Contracts/blob/587f423f64ab56a242c28dfa0c3602ff1cc24292/src/contracts/flattened/flattened_ChainlinkConsumer.sol)

*Interface of the ERC-165 standard, as defined in the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC].
Implementers can declare support of contract interfaces, which can then be
queried by others ({ERC165Checker}).
For an implementation, see {ERC165}.*


## Functions
### supportsInterface

*Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. See the corresponding
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified[ERC section]
to learn more about how these ids are created.
This function call must use less than 30 000 gas.*
